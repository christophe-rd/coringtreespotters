## Summary

The USA National Phenology Network’s (USA-NPN) standardized phenology 
monitoring protocols were designed to capture the seasonal life cycle 
stages of plants and animals across polar, temperate, tropical, and 
water-limited ecosystems. The protocols can be tailored to any sampling 
density or frequency and can be used either within the Nature’s 
Notebook observation program, or independently. The resulting data can 
be used to answer a variety of scientific and management questions from 
local to continental scales. 

The protocols are specific to major taxonomic groups and consist of a 
suite of “phenophases”. A phenophase is an observable stage or phase 
in the annual life cycle of a plant or animal that can be defined by a 
start and end point. For plants, phenophases identify the presence or 
absence of structures (e.g., leaves, flowers, fruits) on an individual 
plant that is observed repeatedly over the course of one or more growing 
seasons. For animals, phenophases identify the presence or absence of 
behaviors such as breeding, migration, and use of food resources. 

Intensity or abundance measures for each phenophase indicate the degree 
to which the phenophase is expressed. They represent either an estimate 
of the number of plant structures or individual animals that are present 
or engaged in a behavior, or an estimate of the percentage of plant 
structures observed in a particular state (e.g., percent of flowers that 
are open). 

In this Plant and Animal Phenophase Definitions document, the phenophases 
in use for major plant and animal taxonomic groups are summarized in 
tables, and the full phenophase definitions and associated intensity or 
abundance measures are included in subsequent sections. The multiple 
files represent updates over time to reduce confusion in the phenophase 
definitions, include new taxonomic groups, and expand protocols to more 
fully capture certain life cycle stages. Be sure to use the most current 
version of the file. Also note the version number for this record does 
not necessarily correspond to the version number of the most recent 
Definitions file.
