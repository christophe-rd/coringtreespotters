**CAOV_12907_N**: verified that the huge gap around 2007 is ok. Yes its a wide ring.

**CAOV_12097_G_II**: outside is rotten. First ring is not 2024. Adjusted for -3 years so first measured ring is 2021. It fits a little better. But not great. 

**ACSA_689-2010_A_II**: verified and measurements are correct
