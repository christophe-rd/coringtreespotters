## Notes ring measurements coringTreespotters
### 12 September

**ACSA_689-2010_A_II**: ring 13 may contain a false ring.

**ACSA_12565_C_I**: first rings are extremely pale but looked at them under the microscope and ok with my decisisons

**BEAL_12843_H_I**:  ring 12 may contain a ring

**BEAL_12843_H_II**: lots of possible false and missing ring. Tried to solve the puzzle with its twin, and they don't match the same narrow rings. 

**BENI_1199_D_II**: wait for its twin as the first rings are super tight and potentially false

**BENI_1251-79_A_II**:  ok
**BENI_1251-79_E_II**: ok

**CAGL_2019_S_I**: ok

**CAGL_6990_A_I**: ok

**PODE_22099_A_I**: ok

**ACSA_187-2006_B_I**: Ok

**ACSA_187-2006_B_II**: Comparing to its twin, I I assume that the stack of cell in the second ring is a false ring. 

**AEFL_12651_D_I**: ok

**AEFL_12651_H_I**: ok 

**CAGL_2019_R_I**: RESCAN

**QUAL_385-82_A_II**: RESCAN


#### Look for the following in bacK UP
BENI 1199 D I:need to be rescaned
CAOV 12907 I II : need to be rescaned
CAGL_6990_A_II: the one with the knot


CHECK ALSO which is the core with a knot

As of today 23 Setp there are 26 cores left to scan, 3 that cant be measured 

## Mysteries
BENI 1199 J I never got scanned


# Missing twin: to check if I have the data somewhere otherwise put it in the rescan box
ACSA 20645 A II: in box to rescan

ACSA 12565: can't get measured

BENI 1199 B II: doesnt exist. was wrongly scanned under B but actually was J. J II has a know thus wont get measured. 

CAGL_2019_R_I: in box to rescan 

CAGL_6990_A_II: the one with the huge knot

CAGL_6990_B_I: doesnt exist

CAOV_12907_I_II:in box to rescan 

PODE_16611_K_I: in box to rescan 

CAOV_12907_B_I: RESCAN
