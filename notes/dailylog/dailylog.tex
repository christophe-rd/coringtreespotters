Arrive in Boston in the morning, Lizzie picked us up and we drove to weldhill and at dana greenhouse. We went to dana greenhouse, dropped off my stuff and went to explore the arboretum and cored 5 trees. We met Lizzie at Weld building around 4pm and went to do groceries. We went back to walter street, made dinner and went to bed.

\section*{ 20 April 2025}
Woke up at 8am, went to Walter street, had breakfast with Mao and cored trees at Peter's hills. Cored 8 trees and went to meet Lizzie and had lunch. We went to meet the treespotters! It was great talking to them. I showed them the cookies and the figure I printed to explain. Then we went to core a basswood and a white oak. Took a group picture and chatted for a little while before going our separate ways. Mao and I went to the maple area of the park and finished all the trees around there. Finished at 5pm.
